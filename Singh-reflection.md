What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

  I was struggling with git pull and then deleting the local branches.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

  The concept of git pull and how to make sure the files in the remote and local locations match up.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

  I asked about git branch -d and also on how to merge conflicts.
What still confuses you about git?

  Nothing really at this point.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

  Pairing was really cool, and it did help clarify alot of the things that I needed help on. It was great to have someone right there to answer your questions.
